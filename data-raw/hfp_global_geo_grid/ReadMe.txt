DESCRIPTION
This archive contains the CIESIN/ Wildlife Conservation Society, WCS Last of the Wild dataset. Documentation for data is available at these web sites:

http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/wildareas/


Updates and corrections may still be made. If you should discover any problems or errors, please inform us at:
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/wildareas/

The archive contains the Human Influence Index grids, Human Footprint grids and Last of the Wild shapefiles. The Human Footprint and Human Influence Index grids are available as compressed zipfiles of ArcInfo GRID. TO access the grids the contents of the zipfiles must be extracted into a single folder. 

DOWNLOADING DATA
The data can be downloaded via the World Wide Web at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/wildareas/. 

Downloaded files need to be uncompressed using either WinZip (Windows file compression utility) or similar applications before they could be accessed in either ArcView or ArcInfo. Users should expect some increase in the size of downloaded data after decompression. 

USE CONSTRAINTS
The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York hold the copyright of this dataset. Users are prohibited from any commercial, non-free resale, or redistribution without explicit written permission from WCS or CIESIN. Users should acknowledge WCS and CIESIN as the source used in the creation of any reports, publications, new data sets, derived products, or services resulting from the use of this data set. WCS or CIESIN also request reprints of any publications and notification of any redistributing efforts.

WORKING WITH Shapefiles.
The last of the wild data are in shapefiles. Shapefiles are native to ArcView 3.x GIS but can be readily opened and edited in ArcInfo without conversion. To access the files content of the zipfile must be uncompressed in a single folder. Users with other GIS softwares may require conversion tools to convert shapefiles to their desired GIS.
